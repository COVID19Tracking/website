# COVID Tracking Project

The COVID Tracking Project collects information from 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other U.S. territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data we can collect for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.

This repository is for the project's **website**: https://covidtracking.com/.

## Development

The website is built on [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). If you are not familiar with Gatsby, we suggest checking out their [excellent documentation](hhttps://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs).

### Environment Variables

Our content is managed in Contentful. All required environment variables are listed (with dummy values) in `.env.example` and you can easily duplicate this file with `cp .env.example .env`, then replace each value with the values you'll find in [our storybook documentation](https://covid19tracking.github.io/website-docs).

### Install

First, you'll need the Gatsby command line interface installed globally:

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Then, install all dependencies by running:

```shell
npm install
```

To run the website locally, use:

```shell
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Any changes you make to code is live-updated. There is a GraphQL preview tool available at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` to see what data is exposed to the website.

Note that any changes you make while running Gatsby will automatically checked with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), so check your console as you save files.

## Storybook

All common components throughout the site are documented in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). You can find all our component stories in `/src/stories`.

To preview the storybook locally, just run:

```shell
npm run storybook
```

The storybook is now available at `http://localhost:6006`.
