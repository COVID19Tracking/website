# Main navigation

The main navigation in the header is pulled from the YAML file at `/src/data/navigation/header.yml`. It's in the following format:

```YAML
name: header
items:
  - title: Get the Data
    link: /data
  - title: About the Data
    link: /about-data
```

The title is the name of the link in navigation, and link is the base-relative link to a page on the site.
