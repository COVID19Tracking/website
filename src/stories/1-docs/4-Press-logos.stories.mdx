# Press logos

The press logos that appear on the homepage are maintained in a YAML file at `/src/data/homepage-data.yml`. The actual logo SVG files are stored in `/static/images/press-logos/`. The YAML file is in the following format:

```yaml
- name: The Wall Street Journal
  logo: the-wall-street-journal.svg
  width: 200
  featured: true
```

Where:

- `name` - The name of the publication
- `logo` - The filename of the logo (relative to `/static/images/press-logos/`)
- `width` - Override the width of the logo (helpful for really wide logos)
- `featured` - Set to `true` to make the logo appear on the homepage.

All logos, regardless of their `featured` option appear in the page `/about/in-the-press`, which you can find in `/src/pages/about/in-the-press.js`.
