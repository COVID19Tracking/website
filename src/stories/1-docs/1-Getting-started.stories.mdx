# Getting started

The COVID Tracking Project website is built using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), and we suggest reading their [excellent documentation](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs) if you need to learn more about the project. To get your local machine set up to develop the website, first install Gatsby if you haven't already done so:

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Then run the following command within your clone of the website:

```shell
npm install
```

## Environment variables

The website requires content from Contentful, which is pulled into the site using a read-only API. Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project. [Add these values](https://gist.github.com/kevee/5d3efced906d5ee0676545d3b761753d) to the file and save it.

## Developing locally

To run the website locally, use:

```shell
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Any changes you make to code is live-updated. There is a GraphQL preview tool available at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` to see what data is exposed to the website.

Note that any changes you make while running Gatsby will automatically checked with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), so check your console as you save files.
