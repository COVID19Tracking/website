# Homepage visualization gallery

The visualization gallery on top of the homepage is a collection of pre-built visualizations that are configurable through Contentful. There are two entry types in Contentful:

- **Homepage visualization gallery** — A collection of visualization items. The most recently created gallery is the one that appears on the homepage. You can feel free to edit an existing one, or create a new one to stage changes.
- **Homepage gallery item** - A single visualization. These have:
- **Name** — An internal Name
- **Label** — The label that appears on top of the visualization (in the tab)
- **Configuration** — A JSON object that passes configuration options.
- **Related post** — A blog post to relate the item to.

You can always edit existing homepage items, or duplicate existing ones to stage a new homepage.
