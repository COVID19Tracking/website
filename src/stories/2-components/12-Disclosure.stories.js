      Testing is a crucial part of any public health response, and sharing test
      data is essential to understanding this outbreak. The CDC is currently not
      publishing complete testing data, so we’re doing our best to collect it
      from each state and provide it to the public. The information is patchy
      and inconsistent, so we’re being transparent about what we find and how we
      handle it—the spreadsheet includes our live comments about changing data
      and how we’re working with incomplete information.
