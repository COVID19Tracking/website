      Data as of May 15; All units are in absolute numbers and states are only
      included if the testing count differs by 5% or more. Our data will always
      be an undercount. We can only track tests that states report, and not all
      states report all tests. More significantly, per-capita testing levels in
      the US remain low, which means that an unknown but probably very large
      number of people are sick, but arenâ€™t being tested.
