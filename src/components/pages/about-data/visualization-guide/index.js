          to the US COVID-19 outbreak. For months, we’ve worked to patch
          together inconsistent state-reported data into a national set of
          numbers for COVID-19 case, death, and testing in the US with full
          daily updates.

          According to our data, US metropolitan areas have been hit the
          hardest. New York leads the rest of the country in the number of
          positive cases by more than 120,000, followed by New Jersey,
          Massachusetts, and Louisiana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because COVID-19 testing and reporting are inconsistent among states,
          it&rsquo;s easy to misinterpret the data. That makes it especially
          important to create clear and accurate visualizations. Otherwise even
          simple and minimalistic graphics can be misleading. If you plan to
          display data from the COVID Tracking Project yourself, please closely
          follow these design and visualization guidelines.

        <h3>Consider normalizing the data.</h3>

          </a>{' '}
          (where each state is shaded in proportion to a statistical variable),
          make sure you encode a population-controlled rate, such as
          &ldquo;positive tests per one million people.&rdquo; If you want to
          show absolute numbers, such as the number of new positive cases per
          day, use a{' '}

        <h3>Choose colors carefully.</h3>
        <p>
          Readers are likely experiencing some latent anxiety, so do your best
          to neither make light of the situation nor be alarmist about it. One
          application of this is in your color choice: You don&rsquo;t want your
          map&rsquo;s color scheme or design to minimize the situation by being
          overly playful or lighthearted. You also don&rsquo;t want to select
          colors that suggest the worst possible outcome.

        <h3>Include the denominator.</h3>
        <p>
          Testing is one of the most important tools in controlling an outbreak.
          When universal testing is implemented, people who are infected with
          the virus can be isolated from folks who test negative. This functions
          as a targeted social distancing technique and can help slow the
          outbreak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charting the number of positive tests alone is often problematic.
          Simple case counts show where people are being tested, not necessarily
          where people are sick. To illustrate the point, a state that reports
          three cases of COVID-19 after testing 2,000 people is probably in a
          different stage of its outbreak than a state that reports three cases
          but has only tested 20 people. But if all you have is a case count,
          those states look exactly the same. That is why we need to include the
          total number of tests as a denominator.

        <h3>Be mindful when comparing states.</h3>
        <p>
          By comparing positive tests to total tests in each state and
          territory, we can get a sense of how widespread a state’s testing
          regime might be (while keeping in mind that{' '}
          <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2010/dec/density-data-text.html">
            population densities vary widely across the country

        <h3>Don’t ignore data uncertainty.</h3>

        <p>
          Though this is a national crisis, each US state or territory reports
          its data differently. We track numbers provided by each state, but the
          quality and frequency of{' '}
          <a href="https://covidtracking.com/about-tracker/#data-quality-grade">
            reports vary widely
          </a>
          . Transparency is crucial. Be honest about what is in the data that
          you are charting and what isn’t. Footnotes and annotations can help
          you make these disclaimers. We publish details about inconsistencies
          in data reporting{' '}
          <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data">
            for every state and territory
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <h3>Use absolute numbers for death counts.</h3>
        <p>
          An organized, collective, and timely response from the government and
          other authorities is a key factor in saving lives. One metric you can
          use to measure the response’s effectiveness is the number of deaths
          attributed to the virus per day and/or per state or territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend using total numbers for plotting deaths to compare one US
          state or territory against another. In this case, adjusting per capita
          adds a layer of abstraction to the graphic. This reduces the
          data&rsquo;s power and the reader&rsquo;s comprehension. It’s easier
          to picture 200 fatalities than 0.0001 fatalities per capita, as{' '}

      <div className={dashboardStyles.moduleFeatured}>
        <h3>Remember that even death counts are uncertain.</h3>
        <p>
          Data that tracks COVID-19 death counts is still a gray area. Though
          some experts prefer to measure the pandemic&rsquo;s severity using the
          number of deaths instead of total cases, several factors could bias
          COVID-19 mortality data.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some concerns that official death statistics may overcount
          COVID-19 fatalities by assuming any patient who tests positive for the
          virus was killed by it. But Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University
          epidemiologist, told{' '}
          <a href="https://factcheck.org/2020/04/social-media-posts-make-baseless-claim-on-covid-19-death-toll/">
            FactCheck.org
          </a>
          &nbsp;that &ldquo;the number of such cases will be small.&rdquo;
          Undercounting is a bigger problem, he says. &ldquo;A greater issue is
          errors in the other direction.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          If people die from COVID-19 before they are tested, their death might
          not be included in the official tally. For example, a{' '}
          <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/surge-number-new-yorkers-dying-home-officials-suspect-undercount-covid-19-related-deaths">
            WNYC/Gothamist investigation
          </a>{' '}
          found that as of Tuesday, April 7, around 200 New Yorkers had died at
          home every day without access to testing and medical treatment.
          That&rsquo;s 10 times higher than NYC&rsquo;s typical at-home death
          rate. These deaths are likely caused by COVID-19. If this effect is
          widespread in the United States, that means official statistics
          undercount the disease’s fatality rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get better grounding when interpreting death rates, consider
          comparing COVID-19 mortality rates for a given location since the
          beginning of the outbreak to fatalities during the same period in
          previous years.
        </p>
        <h3>Be clear and honest.</h3>
        <p>
          While news is moving faster than ever to keep up with the pace of the
          pandemic spread, designers and visualization experts&rsquo; goal is to
          present COVID-19 data in a clear and honest way. Provide context, and
          consider the tips above to avoid common pitfalls in data reporting as
          we seek to inform people during this time of crisis.

            We derive the total value by adding together the positive and
            negative value for each state. This is to account for differences in
            how states reporting pending tests.
          </p>

            We changed the way we report California data on April 1. We synced
            up with the{' '}
            <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19PublicDashboard/Covid-19Public?:embed=y&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no">
              states&apos;s data dashboard
            </a>
            , whereas previously we had published testing updates from other
            sources. This led to a drop in California&rsquo;s reported cases and
            deaths in our dataset on April 1, since the state&rsquo;s data lags
            behind our previous sources.
