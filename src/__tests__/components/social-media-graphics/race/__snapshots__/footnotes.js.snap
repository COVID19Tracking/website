    49
     of 56 states and territories report race/ethnicity information for cases and

Graphic includes demographic data from all states and territories that report, using standard Census categories where possible, and scaled to the total US population for each Census category. Race categories may overlap with Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Some rates are underestimated due to lack of reporting of race and ethnicity categories for COVID-19 cases and deaths.
