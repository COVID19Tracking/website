**Cumulative record of our daily totals. Each day's total is as of 4pm ET that day, so data that comes in from states after that cut-off will show in the *next* day's total.**

We also have [the recent data broken out by state](/data/) on this site. Get the entire dataset as a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRwAqp96T9sYYq2-i7Tj0pvTf6XVHjDSMIKBdZHXiCGGdNC0ypEU9NbngS8mxea55JuCFuua1MUeOj5/pubhtml) or via [API (JSON and CSV)](/api/), [learn how this project works](/about-tracker/), or [dig into detailed documentation on the data itself](/newsroom-expert-faq/).
