As a result, we were unable to update their Total antibody tests (people), Total PCR tests (people), and Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases.\n\nOn February 02, 2021, Alabama reported a large increase in Total antibody tests (people) of approximately 33,000 without explanation. Additionally, **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased by approximately 11,000 without explanation, resulting in a decrease in Negative PCR tests (people).\n\nOn January 30, 2021, Alabama noted on their data dashboard that due to maintenance and upgrades, the Alabama NEDSS Base System did not run on the evening of January 29, 2021, and as as result there would be no update to their dashboard on January 30, 2021. We were only able to update their Currently hospitalized and Ever hospitalized on January 30, 2021.\n\nOn January 22, 2021, Alabama noted that the Alabama Department of Public Health processed a backlog of 409 positive PCR tests dating back to November 19, 2020 through January 20, 2021, and that these tests would be included in their Confirmed cases and Cases (confirmed + probable) for January 22, 2021. As a result, not all new cases reported on January 22, 2021 were reported within the previous 24 hour period.\n\nOn January 13, 2021, Alabama reported that it is reviewing a large number of deaths from the Alabama Center for Health Statistics (ACHS), an endeavor which began on November 11, 2020 and will continue until further notice. As a result, death numbers during this time period reported may include historic deaths and may not accurately reflect new COVID-19 deaths. We urge caution when interpreting these numbers, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics.\n\nOn January 5, 2021, Alabama noted on their COVID-19 dashboard that the cases reported on January 5, 2021 were high due to a delay in testing and reporting over the holiday weekend. On January 7, 2021, they noted that cases and deaths reported through the week of January 7, 2021, may be affected by holiday related reporting delays. We urge caution in using figures from this time period, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics.\n\nOn December 18, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 382 positive PCR test results from December 10, 2020 through December 13, 2020 will be classified as being reported on December 17, 2020.\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 59 positive PCR tests and 479 positive antigen tests from September 29, 2020 through December 14, 2020 would be included in their data for December 15, 2020.\n\nOn December 12, 2020, Alabama announced that they processed a backlog of 398 positive antigen tests from July 7, 2020 through December 9, 2020.  These positive tests will be reported in Alabama’s Probable Cases and Cases (confirmed + probable) on December 12, 2020.\n\nOn December 12, 2020 through December 13, 2020, Alabama did not update their testing data by the time of our daily update. As a result, we were unable to update Total antibody tests (people), Total PCR tests (people), and Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated from Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases.\n\nOn December 9, 2020, Alabama processed a backlog of positive PCR and antigen test results from October 5, 2020 through December 7, 2020. This backlog makes up roughly 10% of Cases (confirmed + probable) reported on December 10, 2020.\n\nOn December 3, 2020, Alabama announced that: \"The Alabama Department of Public Health processed two backlogs totaling 1038 positive PCR results and 473 positive antigen results from two facilities on December 7. These will be classified as 1038 confirmed cases and 473 probable cases reported on 12/08/20 even though the tests were performed during November 30 through December 5, 2020.\"\n\nAs of December 2, 2020, Alabama's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsPeopleViral` field instead of  `totalTestsViral`. Before that, as of September 18, 2020, Alabama's total test results were switched to draw from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of being calculated via positive+negative. The timeseries are the same, but previously, Alabama's units had been unclear, and therefore we stored the series in our specimens field. \n\nOn December 2, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 706 positive PCR tests performed from November 23, 2020 through November 29, 2020 would be included in their daily update for December 2, 2020.\n\nOn December 1, 2020, Alabama [announced](https://twitter.com/alpublichealth/status/1333790272648409093?s=21) that increased new case and death counts are due to delayed data from Thanksgiving.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, Alabama announced that the Alabama Department of Public Health Infection Disease and Outbreak team reviewed their electronic disease surveillance system and “updated some parameters”. As a result, **Recovered** increased by roughly 71k on November 25, 2020.\n\nOn November 14, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 109 positive antigen results would be reported as probable cases on November 14, 2020. As a result, new **Probable cases** reported on November 14, 2020 were not all reported in the previous 24 hour period.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, Alabama announced via their [dashboard](https://alpublichealth.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/6d2771faa9da4a2786a509d82c8cf0f7) that they have begun a review process for deaths from the Alabama Center for Health Statistics (ACHS). According to Alabama, at least half of the **Deaths (confirmed and probable)** reported today (81 in total) are from this review. More deaths may be added from this review in the coming days.\n\nOn November 10, 2020 Alabama’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by roughly 700 without explanation.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, Alabama did not update their COVID-19 dashboard due to \"technical issues\".\n\nOn September 1, 2020, Alabama began displaying the number of people tested by antibody, over 50,000 individuals, separately from its main total tested field, which it clarified represents antigen and PCR testing. Its main total tested number dropped by over 25,000 the same day. We have reached out to the Alabama Department of Public Health to confirm this drop was due to the removal of the individuals tested by antibody.\n\nOn July 11, 2020, Alabama began using direct reports from hospitals for cumulative hospitalizations (which we report in our **Ever hospitalized** metric), rather than state case surveillance. Its number of cumulative hospitalizations increased by over 3,000 as a result.

Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Recovered**, however the time series for this metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads. \n\nOn November 16, 2020 we updated the **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** field to include only residents. We also deleted the time series for **Confirmed cases** because Alaska is lumping PCR and antigen testing for their case definition.\n\nOn November 16, 2020 we added **Cumulative Hospitalized** (which includes both residents and non-residents), although the value does not reflect current hospitalizations.\n\nOn November 7, 2020, Alaska announced that their testing dashboard would be \"temporarily disabled from November 6th to November 9th\" and that testing data could be accessed through their data summary tables. After originally using the data summary tables on November 7, we have reversed that decision, and reverted the values to their November 6th state.

This results in a decrease of Arizona's cumulative hospitalizations.\n\nOn September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed. \n\nOn September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.\n\nFrom July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for **Cases** and **Deaths**, so we could not update **Confirmed Cases,** **Probable Cases,** **Confirmed Deaths,** or **Probable Deaths** during this period. We were still able to update the total data points for **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** and **Deaths (confirmed plus probable)**. We will backfill the separate confirmed and probable case and death data if Arizona provides historical numbers.\n\nOn June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for **Cumulative hospitalized** to match Arizona's dashboard data for \"hospitalized by date admitted.\" Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance.

Arkansas [stated](https://twitter.com/ADHPIO/status/1366163333225799682) that this decrease was because of data clean-up and deduplication.\n\nDuring the week of September 20, 2020, Arkansas made some continual adjustments to its antigen people tested numbers, resulting in some fluctuation in its negatives and totals.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Arkansas's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On December 11, 2020, there is now a 759 difference—3759 deaths among cases, as opposed to 3005 deaths due to COVID. This means 20% of deaths among cases do not have death certificate data, vs. 5% in September, indicating a lag. Previously, on July 1, 2020, we had revised our historical data to reflect the death-certificate metric instead of the deaths-among-cases metric to comply with federal standards from the National Center for Health Statistics. We are also capturing a confirmed/probable breakdown from May 15, 2020 onward, which we did not used to capture since it was not provided for due to COVID.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, we shifted the entire time series of Colorado metrics by one day to match the date that the state reports on its dashboard. \n\nOn November 13, 2020, the state of Colorado reported an increase in **Confirmed cases** that is less than that of the increase in **Positive PCR Tests (people)**.

Because Delaware reports their data as of the previous day, this affects our data for December 18, 2020 and December 19, 2020.\n\nThroughout the week of December 17, 2020, Delaware experienced technical issues with lab reporting. Please exercise caution when looking at their data from this period and be aware that 7 day averages are a more reliable metric than individual figures.\n\nOn December 7, 2020, Delaware announced that they would no longer be reporting **Recovered** as it was “no longer a true reflection of the number of persons that recovered from the disease” because this metric included only cases who had self-reported their recovery to the Division of Public Health. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Recovered**, however the time series for this metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads. \n\nOn October 29, 2020, we moved the data in our **Total Tests (PCR)** field for Delaware to the **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** field after learning that it represents encounters from Delaware's state health department. However, Delaware appears to include antigen tests in its totals, so if an individual is tested using two different test types on the same day, it will get counted twice. Also as of October 29, 2020, Delaware's `totalTestResults` field represents encounters. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field.  \n\nOn September 9, 2020, Delaware reported that  data from September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 would not be available until September 10, 2020 due to a maintenance issue with their electronic reporting system. We will backfill data for September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 to the best of our abilities when data is released\n\nOn September 6, 2020, the Division of Public Health reported a technical issue which caused between 175-200 positive cases to be excluded from Delaware's cumulative confirmed case count. These cases will be added in the coming days. As a result new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the past 24 hour period.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, Delaware revised down total cases and confirmed positives. This is a semi-regular occurrence which will impact Delaware's number occasionally. \n\nOn July 25, 2020, Delaware revised down total cases, confirmed positives, and total tests.\n\nOn April 11, 2020, Delaware revised down negative test results from 10,415 to 9,624.","state":"DE","twitter":"@Delaware_DHSS","childSlug":{"slug":"delaware"},"childLtc":{"current":{"total_cases":3299,"total_death":701,"outbrkfac_alf":null,"outbrkfac_ltc":53,"outbrkfac_other":null,"outbrkfac_nh":null,"date":20210304},"last":{"total_cases":3267,"total_death":683,"date":20210225}}},{"name":"District of Columbia","notes":"On February 16, 2021, the District of Columbia announced that their testing data for the day would be delayed.

We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Florida's separate [hospitalization source](https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/COVIDHospitalizationsCounty?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y). \n\nOn December 10, 2020,  we cleared **Deaths (confirmed)** from August 12 onward and are reporting them as **Deaths (confirmed and probable)**. On August 11, Florida added antigen tests to its data definition for deaths, which were previously PCR only.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Florida did not update their data, presumably due to the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nOn November 3, 2020, Florida’s **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** dropped by over 200 with no explanation.\n\nOn October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer. \n\nOn October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our `totalTestEncountersViral` field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the `T_NegRes` and `C_AllResTypes` values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in `totalTestsPeopleViral`. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as **Total PCR Tests (People)** did not update.\n\nAs of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our **Probable cases** field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.\n\nOn October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, [the Florida Department of Health announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html) that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to \"an unforeseen technical issue\" that was \"not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.\" The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.\n\nOn September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health [announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html) that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.\n\nOn August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for **Cases or Confirmed cases** (`positiveCasesViral` in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** (`positive` in our API) will be unaffected.\n\nOn August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: \"The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.\"\n\nAs of July 10, 2020, Florida reports **Now hospitalized** data for those patients with a \"primary diagnosis of COVID-19.\"\n\nSince May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in **Total PCR Tests (People)**, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in **Total Tests (PCR)**, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does **not** represent the number of specimens.\n\nOn March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its **Negative PCR tests** metric.

Georgia does not provide a full history of this number, so on November 3, 2020 we record 29,937 probable cases for Georgia, many of which do not date to that day.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Georgia stated on its dashboard that its data would be delayed several hours “due to a high volume of data to process.” Georgia’s data did not update before for our publication time.

As a result, case and testing data reported on January 13, 2021 are lower than they would have been had all the data been processed, and case and testing data on January 14, 2021 will be increased, since it will include the previous day's data.\n\nOn December 30, 2020, North Carolina announced on its [dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard) that due to holiday-related disruptions and technical issues, data reported on December 30, 2020 was artificially higher than usual and includes 36 hours of data, while data reported on December 31, 2020 was artificially lower than usual and includes only 12 hours of data.\n\nOn December 24, 2020, North Carolina announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that their data would not be updated on December 24, 2020, or December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the holiday.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, North Carolina announced on their [COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the thanksgiving holiday. However, on November 27, 2020, they will provide data retroactively for November 26, 2020 and we will backfill our historical data accordingly.\n\nOn November 13, 2020, the state of North Carolina [announced](https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/NC/NC-20201113-113612.png) that they are re-defining hospitalization data based on new guidance, whereby hospitalizations are counted by the entire length of stay and not just by length of isolation. This change will likely affect our Now hospitalized metric for the state\n\nOn September 26, 2020, North Carolina started reporting deaths among individuals who had tested positive via antigen. We record this figure in our **Deaths (probable)** field.\n\nOn September 25, 2020, North Carolina started reporting probable cases which caused the **Total Cases** to increase by 4,563.\n\nOn August 12, 2020, North Carolina [announced](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/ncdhhs-corrects-covid-19-testing-totals-after-identifying-labcorp-reporting) a major correction in its **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, resulting in a decrease of more than 220,000 reported tests. \n\nOn July 22, 2020, North Carolina started reporting the number of patients **currently in the ICU**.","state":"NC","twitter":"@ncdhhs","childSlug":{"slug":"north-carolina"},"childLtc":{"current":{"total_cases":50476,"total_death":5009,"outbrkfac_alf":null,"outbrkfac_ltc":null,"outbrkfac_other":346,"outbrkfac_nh":364,"date":20210304},"last":{"total_cases":49474,"total_death":4915,"date":20210225}}},{"name":"North Dakota","notes":"On March 7, 2021, North Dakota’s Total PCR tests (people) decreased by 75 and Negatives decreased by 109 without explanation.\n\nOn February 13, 2021 North Dakota's reported **Total Tests (PCR)** declined by 822 without explanation.\n\nOn February 10, 2021, North Dakota's Confirmed cases decreased by 32 due to an [assessment of software malfunction](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/update-public-health-laboratory-completes-assessment-software-malfunction).\n\nOn February 9, 2021, North Dakota’s Confirmed cases dropped by 62 due to an [assessment of software malfunction](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/update-public-health-laboratory-completes-assessment-software-malfunction), from 93,610 to 93,548.

From December 30, 2020 to January 3, 2021, we captured those numbers combined in our Total Tests (PCR) and Total Test Encounters (PCR) fields. On January 4, 2021, we began reporting these figures separately and revised our historical data to reflect the separate antigen and PCR numbers North Dakota provides.\n\nOn December 25, 2020, North Dakota announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. On January 1, 2020, they noted that there would be no update on January 1, 2020 due to the New Years holiday.\n\nOn December 15, 2020 through December 17, 2020, North Dakota announced that they were resolving a technical issue with their dashboard. As a result, the hospitalization dashboard was unavailable, and we were unable to update their **Now in ICU**, **Ever hospitalized**, and **Ever in ICU** metrics.\n\nOn December 10, 2020, we backfilled **Confirmed cases**, **Probable Cases** and **Total cases** from March 10, 2020 until December 9, 2020. We also cleared our **Deaths (confirmed)** and **Deaths (probable)** metrics because the number we reported as confirmed included antigen tested individuals.\n\nOn December 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting **Probable Cases,** which it defines as individuals with a positive antigen test.\n\nOn December 8, 2020, North Dakota  announced that they would not be updating their website due to site construction as they prepare to add antigen tests to their dashboard. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 8, 2020.\n\nOn December 3, 2020, North Dakota stopped reporting patients Hospitalized with COVID on their COVID-19 dashboard to “eliminate the discrepancy” between patients Hospitalized with COVID and patients Hospitalized due to COVID. As of December 3, 2020, North Dakota’s **Currently hospitalized** will include only patients hospitalized due to COVID.\n\nOn December 1, 2020, we made changes to our historical deaths counts, changing our **Deaths (confirmed)** source from “Deaths Due to COVID-19” to “Total number of individuals who tested positive and died from any cause while infected with COVID-19.” We had originally switched to use “Deaths Due to COVID-19” on July 1, 2020, but because of growing backlogs of individuals with COVID-19 tests whose death certificates have not yet been filed were not being picked up in the figure, we switched back to best reflect the reality in the state. The change caused a 241 cumulative rise in North Dakota’s death figures.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the state dashboard annotation, the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are \"Hospitalized due to COVID\". We are using the \"Hospitalized with COVID\" figure for our **Currently hospitalized** and **Currently in ICU** metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the \"Due to COVID\" Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, North Dakota announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).\n\nOn November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their [daily news release](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0).\n\nAs of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.\n\nOn August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.

These deaths will be added to their counts over the week on February 11, 2021. As a result, new deaths will be substantially higher than normal throughout this period. We urge caution when interpreting data from this period. Our data quality team will continue to investigate how best to handle the addition of these death. Approximately 650 of the deaths reported on February 11, 2021, 2500 of the deaths reported on February 12, 2021, and 1125 of the deaths reported on February 13, 2021 are a result of this reconciliation. On February 15, 2021, Ohio noted that they were continuing to reconcile deaths through a deep review of data which may result in fluctuations in death data.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, we switched Ohio's `totalTestResults` to draw from `totalTestsViral` instead of by calculating from positive+negative. \n\nOn December 29, 2020, Ohio provided a timeseries of Total Tests (PCR), Positive Tests (PCR), Total Antigen Tests, and Positive Antigen Tests. On January 6, 2021, we backfilled all 4 metrics from this download, which resulted in the addition of three new metrics (positive tests PCR, positive tests antigen, total tests antigen) and a full history for Total Tests (PCR).\n\nOn December 25, 2020, Ohio announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview/) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data for December 26, 2020 will include numbers from both December 25, 2020 and December 26, 2020.

As a result not all new **Probable cases** and **Total cases** were reported in the previous 24 hour period. This followed the state reporting on it's COVID-19 Dashboard that the data was incomplete and \"because of unprecedented volume, thousands of reports are pending review\" from November 18, 2020 to December 7, 2020.  \n\nOn November 26, 2020, Ohio announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that there would not be a data update on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

Additionally, on November 23, 2020, Ohio did not update their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** by the time of our daily update. Because `Negative` is calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, we did not update them on November 23, 2020.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, Ohio reported 5246480 **Total PCR tests (specimens)** - the same number that was reported on November 15, 2020, and a drop of roughly 102k tests from November 17, 2020.

As a result of their executive order reports being on a one day lag, we were able to report all metrics except for Confirmed cases, Cases (confirmed + probable), Ever hospitalized, Recovered, and Deaths (confirmed + probable) on December 25, 2020. We were only able to update Confirmed cases, Cases (confirmed + probable), Ever hospitalized, Recovered, and Deaths (confirmed + probable) on December 26, 2020. They also noted that this change in reporting schedule may cause some data to be “artificially inflated”, and as with all data from this period, we urge caution is using these figures.\n\nOn December 17, 2020, Oklahoma announced that due to technical issues on December 16, 2020, they were unable to update their testing data. As a result, we were unable to update **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, **Positive PCR tests (specimens)**, **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**, or Negative PCR tests (people) on December 17, 2020.\n\nAs of December 16, 2020, Oklahoma’s **Currently hospitalized** and **Currently in ICU** include only patients with confirmed COVID-19. Prior to December 16, 2020, they included confirmed COVID-19 patients and people under investigation.\n\nOn December 4, 2020 Oklahoma announced that the increase of 4,287 cases reported today was largely attributable to an issue with the state's reporting system, which resulted in the inclusion of backlogged cases from December 2 to December 4.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, Oklahoma announced via a [COVID-19 Situation update](https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/articles/situation-update-covid-19-11252020) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Because much of the data that we get for Oklahoma is sourced from their executive order reports, which are on a one day lag, we will only be able to partially update Oklahoma’s data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020 as a result.\n\nOn July 19 and July 20, Oklahoma noted that reported **Total cases** numbers were inaccurately low due to technical issues. \n\nPrior to April 10, 2020, Oklahoma reported \"Positive (Out-of-State)\" results.

Before Oregon switched to reporting tests in units of specimens, we had used its figures for people testing positive to represent confirmed cases and subtracted that number from total cases to get probable cases. However, it turned out that Oregon's people tested figure included people testing positive with antigen, so the positive people tested figure did not accurately reflect confirmed cases.\n\nOn January 29, 2021, Oregon [announced](https://twitter.com/ohaoregon/status/1355286471687745537?s=21) that their COVID-19 case database would be down “for server and file migration maintenance” on January 30, 2021, and as a result there would be no update to their data on January 31, 2021. Because Oregon’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries due to late updates, we were unable to update their data on February 1, 2021.\n\nAs of December 9, 2020, Oregon’s total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. This change will cause Oregon’s `totalTestResults` to begin on March 29, 2020 instead of March 4, 2020. Because Oregon’s totalTestsViral represent only electronic laboratory reporting, whereas its cases and negatives represented tests from all sources, this change causes a decrease of 10,296 tests in `totalTestResults` on March 29. The old numbers remain available by summing the positive and negative fields of our API.\nIn addition, Oregon has not reported their total tests in people units since December 2, 2020 and they indicated that they will not continue to report total tests in people, so we have removed any values in **Total PCR tests (people)** we previously carried over.\n\nOn December 3, 2020, Oregon removed its total people tested metric, after adding total specimens on December 1. Because they did not provide a full timeseries of specimens, as of December 4, we switched our totalTestResults from people to specimens on December 2, 2020, and stopped calculating **Negative (people or cases)**. This causes an artificial increase of totalTestResults by 960,248 on that day. \n\nOn December 1, 2020, **Negative (people or cases)** decreased by 3,258 from 968,686 to 965,428. Oregon did not post an explanation. Since `totalTestResults` are computed positive+negative in the state, this caused `totalTestResults` to drop by 2,035.\n\nOn November 5, 2020 we began reporting current hospitalizations from [Oregon's COVID-19 Update Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/oregon.health.authority.covid.19#!/vizhome/OregonCOVID-19Update/HospitalCapacity). Previously we had been capturing these metrics on the [Oregon Health Authority page](https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19).\n\nOn November 4, 2020, Oregon stopped reporting current hospitalization data on the [Oregon Health Authority page](https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19), and so we did not update Oregon's current hospitalization data.

As a result all testing numbers were frozen until the state resumed updating them on December 4, 2020.  Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this update will be shown on our data for December 5, 2020.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Washington's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Washington switched its total tests units to testing encounters, excluding future encounters from individuals who test positive. It also provided a full timeseries of the figure. This testing encounters figure is slightly different from how we define testing encounters in two ways: first, our definition of testing encounters includes encounters after a positive test, and second, it should be calculated not by summing resulted tests but by counting all daily tests in a separate reporting stream. Despite these differences, the historical and current values of Washington’s figure are still stored in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.\n\nOn August 2, 2020, Washington state Department of Health reported that \"DOH is continuing to experience issues with its reporting system today. We are able to report cases, deaths and hospitalizations but have not reported new negative test results since 8/1.\"\n\nOn July 14, 2020, Washington state revised its count of COVID-19 **deaths** downward by 39, because it determined that even though those 39 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.\n\nOn June 22, 2020, we updated previous values for **cases** and **total tests** in our time-series using data from Washington state's dashboard. This update caused an artificial decrease in cases and tests between June 21 and June 22.\n\nOn June 18, 2020, Washington revised its **Total PCR tests (people)** downward. On the same date, Washington decreased its count of COVID-19 **deaths by 7**, because it determined that even though those 7 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.\n\nOn April 18, 2020, Washington state removed 190 **confirmed cases** that were discovered to be out-of-state residents tested in Washington laboratories. \n\nBetween March 31 and April 15, 2020, Washington state did not report **Negative PCR tests (people)**.

In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.\n\nNegatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.\n\nOn February 9, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) fell from 704,836 to 595,970. We carried the previous day’s number as we believed this may have been an error. On February 10, 2021, we learned that the decrease was \"Due to recent changes in reporting by commercial laboratories, some test results were being counted twice. Testing numbers have been corrected to reflect these changes therefore a decrease in the testing numbers will be observed for Non-WPHL labs. That decrease is attributed to the removal of duplicate tests being reported\". As a result of this new information, we are backfilling our Total PCR tests (specimens) to reflect this new information and ensure that our data aligns as closely as possible with Wyoming's.\n\nOn February 7, 2021, Wyoming’s **Confirmed cases** decreased by 36 and **Recovered** decreased by 2 with no explanation.\n\nOn February 02, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by roughly 4,600 and their Total PCR tests (people) decreased by approximately 1,500 without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases, decreased by roughly 1,600.\n\nOn January 25, 2021, Wyoming’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by roughly 106k, and their **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased by about 3.6k without explanation. Their **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** and **Negative PCR tests (specimens)** did not reflect that decrease, so we did not update their **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, **Total PCR tests (people)**, or **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which is calculated as **Total PCR tests (people)** minus **Confirmed cases** on January 25, 2021 to ensure our data is as accurate as possible.\n\nOn January 12, 2021, Wyoming reported more new Confirmed cases than new Total PCR tests (people). As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed Cases decreased by 85.\n\nOn December 24, 2020, Wyoming announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) that there would be no update to their data on December 24, 2020 or December 25, 2020. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021.We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Wyoming's separate [hospitalization source](https://sites.google.com/wyo.gov/exec-covid19/hospital-resources) on both days.\n\nOn December 2, 2020, Wyoming's cumulative **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 2,000, **Negative PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 13,000, and **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 11,000. The data for these metrics, obtained by downloading the Crosstab data on [Wyoming's State and County Dashboards](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/), has been unreliable over the last week. Please use caution when using this data.  \n\nAs of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. \n\nOn November 27, 2020, Wyoming’s **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by about 10,000 without explanation. We believed that this decrease may be an error, and did not update Wyoming’s **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** and **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**, which come from the same source on November 27, 2020. On November 28, 2020, and November 29, 2020, we were unable to update Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens) because Wyoming only updates these metrics on Monday through Friday.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Wyoming announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, we started collecting *Total PCR tests (specimens)* from the \"Wyoming Updates\" section of Wyoming's [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) and started collecting **Positive tests PCR (specimens)** and **Negative tests PCR (specimens)** from the values in the graph on the \"Laboratory Results by Date\" graph on their [COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/). At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.\n\nOn November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s **Confirmed cases** increased by more than their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** without explanation. As a result, **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased.\n\nOn October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people)** values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.\n\nOn June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.\n\nOn April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.\n\nDuring the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its **Recovered** metrics.\n\nDuring the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases
