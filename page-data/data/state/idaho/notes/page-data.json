Because their data is on a one day lag in our timeseries due to late updates, we will be unable to update their data on Mondays, and data reported on Tuesdays will include two days of data. \n\nOn February 12, 2021, Idaho [announced](https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1360362916973744131) via the official Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Twitter that there would be no update to their data on February 15, 2021 due to the President’s day holiday. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we were unable to update their data on February 16, 2021.\n\nOn January 20, 2021, Idaho [announced](https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1352057437608583168) that two deaths had been removed from their total after updated records indicated that they were not due to COVID-19. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag due to late updates, this affects our Deaths (confirmed + probable) and Deaths (confirmed) for January 21, 2021\n\nOn January 18, 2021, Idaho [announced](https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1351318456206032903) via the official Idaho Department of Health and Welfare twitter that there would be no update to their data due to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data published on January 19, 2021 would include two days of data. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries this affects our data for January 19, 2021 and January 20, 2021.\n\nOn January 12, 2021, Idaho reported 10 cumulative probable deaths on their dashboard,  a decrease from the 179 probable deaths reported the day before. We suspect that this is an error, and in order to ensure that our data is as accurate as possible, we carried over the existing value for Probable deaths on January 12, 2021.\n\nOn December 25, 2020, Idaho [announced](https://twitter.com/IDHW) via the official Idaho Department of Health and Welfare twitter that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. On December 31, 2020, they [noted](https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1344793943876145152) that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021. Because Idaho's data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we were unable to update their data on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021.\n\nOn December 9, 2020, Idaho's **Total PCR Tests (People)** dropped from 492,265 from 494,914 with no explanation.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Idaho announced that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our historical data due to consistently updating after we publish our daily update, we will be unable to update their data on November 27, 2020.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Idaho's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsPeopleViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, after another period of missing data for **Hospitalized now**, Idaho reported current hospitalizations of 106, down from the previous report of 223 on July 31. It reported a similar drop in ICU patients from 51 on July 31 to 22 on August 4.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Idaho reported 126 total **deaths** but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths, for a calculated total of 136 deaths. We treated the 33 probable deaths data point as an error and reported 126 total deaths for this date, including 103 confirmed and 23 probable deaths. See Idaho state page screenshots for July 22. \n\nFrom July 13 through July 21, 2020, Idaho was unable to report **Hospitalized now** data due to HHS regulation changes. Idaho retroactively made figures available for these days on July 21, 2020, and we revised our figures to match.\n\nOn July 8, 2020, Idaho revised its historical numbers for **Hospitalized now**. We updated our hospitalization figures for Idaho from March 23 to July 13, 2020 to match on July 17, 2020.\n\nOn July 3, 2020, Idaho revised down their **Recovered** data by about 1,500, noting that \"an error in auto-calculation was discovered.\"\n\nOn June 5, 2020, Idaho reported a large batch of previously unreported tests. The state's **Total tests** number rose by approximately 2,500 more tests on June 5 than the seven-day average for new tests at that time.\n\nAs of April 9, 2020, Idaho reports **probable and confirmed cases** separately.
