This in turn affected **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which is calculated as **Total PCR Tests (people)** minus **Confirmed cases**.\n\nOn February 8, 2021, New Hampshire's **Total antigen tests (specimens)** decreased by 102 without explanation.\n\nOn January 10, 2021, New Hampshireâ€™s **Total antigen tests (specimens)** increased by 41167 without explanation.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, New Hampshire did not update their COVID-19 data by the time of our daily update.\n\nOn December 26, 2020, we began capturing New Hampshire's \"Antigen Positive\" cases as **Probable cases** instead of **Positive antigen tests (people)** and revised its historical numbers so that **Confirmed cases** reflected only PCR positives. We also modified *Negative (people or cases)* to subtract these confirmed cases. Because negatives are calculated from lumped figures including antigen before November 20, negatives are artificially high on that day.\n\nOn December 25, 2020, New Hampshire did not update their data, presumably due to the Christmas holiday.\n\nOn November 13, 2020, New Hampshire announced: \"The Dashboard Service is currently undergoing system maintenance and will be restored by November 16, 4:00 PM EST.\"  This means **Total tests (in specimens)**, **Ever hospitalized**, **Ever in ICU**, and **Total Antibody Tests** will not be updated during this time.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, New Hampshire's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, New Hampshire did not update their dashboards or summary report by the time of our update. \n\nOn September 2, 2020, New Hampshire did not update their dashboards or summary report by the time of our update.\n\nAs of May 25, 2020, New Hampshire reports PCR tests separately from antibody tests."},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/7/2021 09:00","dateModified":"March 7, 2021 9:00 am"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":2,"ltc":1,"crdt":2},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/dphs/cdcs/2019-ncov.htm","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.nh.gov/covid19/documents/case-summary.pdf","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://www.nh.gov/covid19/dashboard/overview.htm#dash","name":"New Hampshire","state":"NH","twitter":"@NHPubHealth","childSlug":{"slug":"new-hampshire"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
