As a result, new referrals of confirmed cases to the MDSS regularly affect the Confirmed cases we report on Mondays and over the weekend.\n\nOn March 4, 2021, we deleted the history of **Negative (people or cases)**, because they represented negative tests, not individuals. Now that `totalTestResults` is not calculated from positive+negative, we do not need to duplicate negative specimens in the people field.\n\nAs of March 4, 2021, Michigan's `totalTestResults` are drawn from `totalTestsViral` instead of calculated via positive+negative. The total tests grew by 96,532, mostly due to addition of repeat positive tests.\n\nOn March 4, 2021, we fixed an error in a backfill from June 11, 2020, where we forgot to paste historical data from March 10, 2020 to March 16, 2020 for Positive Tests (PCR), Negative Tests (PCR), Total Tests (PCR), and Deaths.\n\nAs of July 7, 2020, Michigan updates its death figures three times a week after conducting reviews of death certificates. As a result, \"new\" deaths may not always reflect deaths in the past 24 hours.\n\nOn January 2, 2021, Michigan did not publish updated testing data by the time of our daily update. As a result, we were unable to update Total Antibody Tests, Total Tests (PCR), Positive Tests (PCR), Negative Tests (PCR), or Negative (People or Cases) on January 2, 2021.\n\nOn December 23, 2020, Michigan announced via a [press release](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-548250--,00.html) that their data would not be updated on December 24, 2020, December 25, 2020, December 31, 2020, or January 1, 2021 due to the holidays.\n\nOn November 24, 2020, Michigan announced via a [press release](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-545993--,00.html) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to Thanksgiving holiday. On November 27, 2020, the state resumed data reporting where case counts would include cases since Wednesday, November 25, 2020. The state estimated that the average number of cases across November 26 and November 27, 2020 would be 8,581 cases per day.\n\nOn October 29, 2020, Michigan experienced connectivity issues resulting in some cases that would have been reported tomorrow to be reported today. This is due to the fact that the state has a strict 10AM cutoff for daily data reporting. This means the daily increase in cases encompasses more than one day's worth of data.\n\nOn October 15, 2020, Michigan announced that due to a laboratory result processing slowdown, several cases that would normally have been included in the October 14, 2020 update were reported on October 15, 2020. The issue has since been resolved. As a result, cases reported on October 15, 2020 may not have been reported within the last 24 hour period.\n\nOn June 11, 2020, we updated our historical data from a spreadsheet provided by Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services in order to reflect the lab-reported dates of **probable and confirmed cases** and **probable and confirmed deaths** by date of death.\n\nSince March 10, 2020, Michigan has reported each day's Positive and Negative tests (people) by county but has never totaled these metrics for the state. We add new Positive and Negative tests (people) values daily to a running sum and report the total.
