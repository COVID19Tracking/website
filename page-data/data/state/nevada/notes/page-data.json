The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.\n\nOn October 29, 2020, Nevada’s Total Tests (PCR) increased by a smaller amount than the increase in Cases. Because Negative test results are calculated by subtracting Confirmed cases from Total PCR tests (people), Negative test results decreased on October 29, 2020.\n\nOn October 15, 2020, Nevada stopped reporting the number of unique people who tested negative on their dashboard without explanation. We carried forward the last reported number of people tested negative between October 15 and October 21 (our policy when a metric goes missing without notice is to “freeze” the number for up to seven days to allow states to recover from temporary reporting problems). Since our API uses the sum of positive+negative tests to calculate the total number of tests in Nevada, this caused the number of total tests on those dates to increase only by the number of positives. On October 21, 2020, we updated the number of Nevada’s negative tests for October 15 through October 20 based on a calculation of (Total people tested – Cases)\n\nOn October 15, 2020, Nevada stopped reporting **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and began reporting **Total PCR tests (test encounters)**. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, however the time series for the specimens metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads.
