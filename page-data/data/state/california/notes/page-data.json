As a result, many of the deaths reported on February 25, 2021 occurred between December 3, 2020 and February 3, 2021. We urge caution when interpreting numbers from this period, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics than individual figures.\n\nOn December 16, 2020, California [announced](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-338.aspx) that their cases for December 16, 2020 include 15,337 cases from previous days due to a change in case processing. It appears this new process will regularly include a higher volume of cases that were not identified within the previous 24 hours.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, California's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.\n\nFrom July 23 through July 28, 2020, California reported that its **Now hospitalized** and **Now in ICU** were incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for this period if the complete data becomes available.\n\nFrom June 29 to July 5, 2020, California made revisions to daily **case** numbers. On July 17, we updated the values based on the most recent data from the state dashboard.\n\nOn July 8, 2020, California data included a backlog from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. Approximately 1,000 of the 11,000 new cases were attributed to this backlog data.\n\nAs of April 22, 2020, California has reported specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.\n\nOn April 4 and April 22, 2020, California reported large batches of backlogged **negative test** data. \n\nPrior to April 1, 2020, we used county data sources for more reliably timely reporting of California's COVID-19 data. At the start of April, we began reporting primarily from the state data dashboard(s). This led to a modest drop in **cases** and **deaths**, as the state's data lags behind the county sources."},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/7/2021 02:59","dateModified":"March 7, 2021 2:59 am"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":1,"ltc":3,"crdt":3},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://update.covid19.ca.gov","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19CasesDashboard_15931020425010/Cases?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19HospitalsDashboard/Hospitals?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no","name":"California","state":"CA","twitter":"@CAPublicHealth","childSlug":{"slug":"california"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
