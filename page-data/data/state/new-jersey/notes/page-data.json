{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-state-notes-js","path":"/data/state/new-jersey/notes","result":{"data":{"covidStateInfo":{"notes":"The **Recovered** data point we report for New Jersey reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.\n\nNegative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.\n\nNew Jersey does not update their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** everyday. If **Total PCR tests (specimens)** is not updated, we are unable to update their **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**, which is calculated as **Total PCR tests (specimens)** minus **Confirmed cases**.\n\nOn March 6, 2021, New Jersey’s Ever hospitalized decreased by 916 without explanation.\n\nOn February 8, 2021, New Jersey [reported](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1358841345859870721) that today's data is artificially low due to electronic lab reporting issues. Data reported on February 9, 2021 is expected to correct the backlog.\n\nOn January 15, 2021, New Jersey’s Probable cases decreased from 59,881 to 31,717 on their [data dashboard](https://covid19.nj.gov/#live-updates) without explanation. We believe this decrease may have been a mistake and sourced this data point from the [underlying data layer](https://services7.arcgis.com/Z0rixLlManVefxqY/arcgis/rest/services/DailyCaseCounts/Feat[…]27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27TOTAL_AG_CASES%27%7D%5D) (today's value is 60,791) in order to avoid the decrease.\n\nOn January 8, 2021 New Jersey’s Probable cases increased from 53,967 to 72,123 without explanation. This affected their Cases (confirmed + probable), which is calculated as Confirmed cases plus Probable cases in the absence of an explicit total case number. On January 9, 2021, their Probable cases decreased from 72,123 to 56,147. Because of this, we believe that the figure reported on January 8, 2021 was a mistake, and have corrected the number in our timeseries. \n\nOn October 23, New Jersey's reported **Ever hospitalized** value increased dramatically from 24,517 to 37,222 with no explanation we could find: this was probably a one-time addition of backlogged data.\n\nOn August 7, 2020, we back-filled New Jersey's **Probable deaths** with data provided by the state. This removed apparent spikes in deaths due to the state's irregular reporting.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, New Jersey's **Now hospitalized** number decreased by 268 people.\n\nOn July 19, 2020, New Jersey's **Total cases** decreased, perhaps due to reclassification of probable cases.\n\nOn July 16, 2020, New Jersey's **Recovered** figure decreased.\n\nOn May 16, 2020, a backfill effort by New Jersey caused the state's data for **Recovered** to rise by approximately 7,000 people.
