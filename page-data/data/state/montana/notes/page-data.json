This change resulted in a decrease of 5147 tests due to the removal of probable cases from the figure.\n\nOn March 6, 2021, Montana’s Confirmed cases decreased by 173 without explanation.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, we backfilled the history of Montana's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** using data from its dashboard. This allowed us to get historical testing data we did not have from March 7, 2020 to March 27, 2020. Additionally, we cleared the values in Montana's **Negative (people or cases)** time series back to March 21, 2020. These values mixed units and are no longer needed since `totalTestResults` will no longer be calculated via positive+negative.\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Montana's Confirmed cases decreased by 91 without explanation.\n\nOn February 25, 2021, Montana’s Confirmed cases decreased by 83 without explanation.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, Montana’s **Confirmed cases** decreased by 117 without explanation.\n\nOn January 27, 2021, we discovered that the **Confirmed cases** figure we had been capturing for Montana included both confirmed and probable cases, and cleared their **Confirmed cases** timeseries from April 30, 2020 through January 26, 2021 as a result. Beginning on January 27, 2021, we will capture **Confirmed cases** and **Probable cases** from the demographics tab of their dashboard, and will backfill our timeseries as we are able to.\n\nOn December 25, 2020, Montana announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://montana.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=7c34f3412536439491adcc2103421d4b) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021 due to the holidays. We were able to update Currently in ICU and Currently on Ventilator from Montana's separate [hospitalization source](https://dphhs.mt.gov/publichealth/cdepi/diseases/coronavirusmt/demographics).\n\nOn December 14, 2020, Montana announced that due to updates to their data reporting system on December 13, 2020, no new cases could be reported on December 13, 2020. We were unable to update Cases (confirmed + probable) and Negative PCR tests (people) on December 14, 2020.\n\nOn November 16, 2020, Montana’s Confirmed cases increased by more than their Total PCR tests (specimens) without explanation. As a result Negative test results which are calculated by subtracting Confirmed cases from Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased.\n\nOn November 8, 2020, Montana's reported **Recovered** value decreased by 32 with no explanation."},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/7/2021 01:59","dateModified":"March 7, 2021 1:59 am"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":2,"ltc":1,"crdt":2},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://montana.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=7c34f3412536439491adcc2103421d4b","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://dphhs.mt.gov/publichealth/cdepi/diseases/coronavirusmt/demographics","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://dphhs.mt.gov/Portals/85/publichealth/documents/CDEpi/DiseasesAtoZ/2019-nCoV/Status%20Update%20Data%20Report_5312021.pdf","name":"Montana","state":"MT","twitter":"@dphhsmt","childSlug":{"slug":"montana"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
