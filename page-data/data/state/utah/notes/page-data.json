As a result, we were unable to update their Cases (confirmed + probable) and hospitalization and death data. We will backfill the missing data as soon as it has been reviewed.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, we cleared the history of Utah's **Confirmed cases** field, which we previously filled using data from its positive people tested via PCR number. Utah does not present this figure as confirmed cases and instead calls its main case number, which includes both PCR and antigen tests, \"lab-confirmed cases.\" We did not duplicate Utah's main case number into Confirmed cases to replace this positive PCR individuals number because the definition the state uses for \"confirmed\" is not in accordance with CSTE definitions.\n\nOn December 25, 2020, Utah did not update their data by the time of our daily update, presumably due to the Christmas holiday.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, Utah [announced](https://twitter.com/UtahCoronavirus/status/1331703634942451715) via their official Utah COVID-19 response twitter that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Additionally, the data that would normally have been published on November 26, 2020 will be included in the November 27, 2020 update.\n\nAs of November 9, 2020, our **Confirmed cases** metric for Utah is sourced from the data download available on the [Utah dashboard](https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/), which separates PCR and antigen tests. This caused a slight decrease in the number of **Confirmed Cases**.\n\nAs of November 6, 2020, our **Total PCR tests (people)** and **Negative PCR tests (people)** metrics for Utah are sourced from the data download available on the [Utah dashboard](https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/), which separates PCR and antigen tests.\n\nAs of October 28, 2020, our **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** metrics for Utah are sourced from the data download available on the [Utah dashboard](https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/), which separates PCR and antigen tests. **Total PCR tests (specimens)** is calculated by adding positive and negative PCR tests from this [download](https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/Utah_COVID19_data.zip).\n\nAs of October 29, 2020, Utah's `totalTestResults` field represents encounters instead of pos+neg. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field. \n\nAs of July 16, 2020, Utah is reporting both specimens and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested.\n\nAs of June 11, 2020, Utah reports a combined case count for total intubated patients and patients on a ventilator. We report this figure as **Ever on ventilator**."},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/7/2021 09:35","dateModified":"March 7, 2021 9:35 am"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":2,"ltc":2,"crdt":2},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#hospitalizations-mortality","covid19SiteTertiary":null,"name":"Utah","state":"UT","twitter":"@utahdepofhealth","childSlug":{"slug":"utah"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
