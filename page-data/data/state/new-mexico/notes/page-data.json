On March 5, 2021, we backfilled **Total PCR tests (specimens)** from March 7, 2020 through April 10, 2020 from screenshots of New Mexico's dashboard. We also cleared Negative (People or cases) after April 6, 2020 and we cleared the history of New Mexico's **Negative (people or cases)**. The number previously mixed units and is no longer needed since `totalTestResults` are no longer calculated via positive+negative.\n\nOn January 15, 2021, New Mexicoâ€™s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by approximately 13,000 without explanation.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, we shifted the entire time series of New Mexico metrics by one day to match the date that the state reports on its dashboard.
