Kansas notes that this metric only includes cases with available discharge information reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, Kansas noted that a decrease in Deaths (confirmed and probable) was due to a death certificate review which revealed 4 cases where COVID-19 was not the main cause or contributing cause of death.\n\nOn December 25, 2020, Kansas announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.coronavirus.kdheks.gov/160/COVID-19-in-Kansas) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the holiday.\n\nOn December 3, 2020, Kansas’ **Currently hospitalized** decreased by 342 without explanation. Kansas does not usually update their data on Thursdays.\n\nOn November 13, 2020, Kansas announced that there was a \"technical issue with displaying the number of negative tests and people tested\" but that no other metrics were effected. The values for **Total tests (people)**, and the `Negative` field in the API, were carried over and will be updated if they become available.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Kansas’s **Total tests (people)** and `Negative` decreased without explanation.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, the **Currently in Icu** value for KS dropped from 81 to 1 on the state's dashboard. We recorded it, but expect it to be revised at another point. \n\nOn July 15, 2020, Kansas began reporting additional data from hospitals, and at that time, data for the **Now hospitalized** metric was only available through July 10.\n\nFrom July 1–July 3, 2020, we reported incorrect numbers for Kansas **Cases or Confirmed cases**. We have corrected the error.\n\nAs of May 7, 2020, **confirmed and probable cases** are included in the case totals."},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/5/2021 10:00","dateModified":"March 5, 2021 10:00 am"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":2,"ltc":2,"crdt":2},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://www.coronavirus.kdheks.gov/160/COVID-19-in-Kansas","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19TableauVersion2/HospitalCapacity?%3Aembed=y&%3AshowVizHome=no","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19TableauVersion2/TestingRates?%3Aembed=y&%3AshowVizHome=no","name":"Kansas","state":"KS","twitter":"@kdhe","childSlug":{"slug":"kansas"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
