As a result, **Negative (People or Cases)** saw a decline from the previous day since it is calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.\n\nOn November 10, 2020, Missouri’s Total PCR tests (specimens), Negative PCR tests (specimens), Total PCR tests (people), Total antibody tests (specimens), Total antibody tests (people), Negative antibody tests (specimens), Total antigen tests (specimens), and Negative antigen tests (specimens) dropped without explanation.\n\nOn November 8, 2020, Missouri's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased from 2,672,288 to 2,654,691 with no explanation.\n\nOn October 14, 2020, Missouri testing numbers by people decreased. This resulted in a decrease in all total testing numbers (people) and negative cases. Testing numbers by specimen are unaffected.\n\nOn October 11, 2020, [Missouri announced that a database error had resulted in an “incorrect inflation” of cases in its October 10, 2020 report](https://www.kshb.com/news/coronavirus/missouri-covid-19-database-error-causes-incorrect-inflation-of-cases). When The COVID Tracking Project is able to obtain correct official data for October 10 from Missouri, we will update our dataset to reflect the correction.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, Missouri added current hospitalizations to their COVID-19 dashboard, and we began to capture this metric. Historical data is also available and we are working on backfilling our data for days where this metric was unavailable.\n\nAs of October 7, 2020, Missouri's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`. \n\nOn September 28, 2020, Missouri removed the Positive and Negative antibody tests (people) metrics from their dashboards. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Positive antibody tests (people)** and **Negative antibody tests (people)**, however the time series for these metrics are available in the historical data, and our data downloads. \n\nOn September 5, 2020, the Missouri DHSS [added an additional 72 deaths](http://twitter.com/HealthyLivingMo/status/1302314149620391937?s=20) to their total count, \"most of which occurred June-August\".\n\nAs of May 22, 2020, Missouri reports PCR tests separately from antibody tests.
