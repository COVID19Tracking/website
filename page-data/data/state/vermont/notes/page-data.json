On January 1, 2020, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2020. \n\nOn December 23, 2020, Vermont reported more new **Confirmed cases** than new **Total PCR Tests (people)**, which caused a decrease in the value of **Negative PCR tests (people)** in our API.\n\nOn December 4, 2020, Vermont provided a timeseries for both confirmed and probable cases. We backfilled **Total cases**, **Confirmed cases** and **Probable cases** and updated **Total Tests (in People)** and **Negative** to match the new confirmed series.\n\nOn December 2, 2020, Vermont added approximately 120 cases to its case count, representing **Probable cases** since the beginning of September in the state (previously, the state had only reported PCR-confirmed cases). It provided a timeseries, and we backfilled our **Total cases** field to avoid the impression of an additional 120 case rise on December 2.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Vermont announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.\n\nOn November 3, 2020, Vermont’s **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased without explanation. As a result, Vermont’s negative test results, which are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased as well.\n\nOn October 29, 2020, Vermont started publishing **Total PCR Tests (in specimens)** in addition to **Total PCR Tests (in people)**. We backfilled the full time series for this metric from Vermont's Arcgis layer.\n\nAs of October 29, 2020, Vermont's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. \n\nOn September 23, 2020, Vermont's **total tests** decreased by about 80 tests with no explanation. \n\nOn August 19, 2020, Vermont's **total tests** decreased by about 200 tests with no explanation.  \n\nBetween May 15 and May 16, 2020, Vermont's **total tests** decreased by about 1,000 tests with no explanation."},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/6/2021 23:59","dateModified":"March 6, 2021 11:59 pm"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":2,"ltc":2,"crdt":2},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/85f43bd849e743cb957993a545d17170","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/current-activity-vermont#dashboard","covid19SiteTertiary":null,"name":"Vermont","state":"VT","twitter":"@healthvermont","childSlug":{"slug":"vermont"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
