We sum these numbers in a running total to report a value for the total number of antibody tests West Virginia has conducted. \n\nOn March 5, 2021, we cleared the history of West Virginia's **Negative (people or cases)**. The number previously mixed units and is no longer needed since `totalTestResults` are no longer calculated via positive+negative.\n\nAs of March 5, 2021, West Virginia's `totalTestResults` are drawn directly from `totalTestsViral` instead of calculated via positive+negative. This change resulted in a decrease of 26637 tests due to the removal of probable cases from the figure.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, we backfilled the history of West Virginia's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** from data scraped from its dashboard. This allowed us to get historical testing data we did not have from March 13, 2020 to April 28, 2020.\n\nOn March 2, 2021, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources [announced](https://dhhr.wv.gov/News/2021/Pages/COVID-19-Daily-Update-3-2-2021.aspx) that a backlog of testing results from December and January had been reported to the state after the February 26, 2021 dashboard update was published. These testing results were mistakenly reported as positive instead of negative, and are being corrected in the electronic disease surveillance system. This issue is expected to be resolved on the dashboard within the next few days. We urge caution when interpreting numbers from this time period.\n\nOn July 4, 2020, West Virginia began making continual changes to its previous data for antibody testing, so its historical time series might not match the time series we collected.\n\nOn May 23, 2020, West Virginia began reporting PCR and antibody tests separately. Total test values before this date might include both PCR and antibody tests.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, West Virginia began reporting current hospitalization, ICU, and ventilator metrics from 49 of 55 counties. Before April 16, 2020, those counts were less complete, as they were based on completed investigations rather than on hospital data."},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/6/2021 23:59","dateModified":"March 6, 2021 11:59 pm"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":2,"ltc":2,"crdt":1},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx","name":"West Virginia","state":"WV","twitter":"@WV_DHHR","childSlug":{"slug":"west-virginia"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
