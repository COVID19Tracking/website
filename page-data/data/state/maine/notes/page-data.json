The new values reflect testing on Maine residents only.\n\nOn December 25, 2020, Maine announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml) that some of their data would not be updated between December 25, 2020 and December 27, 2020 due to the holiday. As a result, we were unable to update Maine’s testing and current hospitalization data on December 25, 2020, and unable to update any data on December 26, 2020.\n\nOn December 9, 2020, Maine’s **Total Antigen Tests (specimens)** decreased by 248 on their COVID-19 page, which we believe was an error. The sum of **Positive Antigen Tests,** **Negative Antigen Tests,** and indeterminate antigen tests is 38,632 and Maine reported 36,632. In order to ensure that our data is as accurate as possible, we did not update Maine’s Total Antigen Tests (specimens) on December 9, 2020. (Antigen data is available in our CSVs and API.)\n\nOn November 30, 2020, Maine’s Total antigen tests (specimens) and Negative antigen tests (specimens) increased by roughly 11,000, and their Positive antigen tests (specimens) increased by about 400 without explanation. \n\nOn November 26, 2020, Maine announced on their COVID-19 page that there would only be partial updates to their data from November 26, 2020 to November 29, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. As a result, we were unable to update testing data, and current hospitalization data on November 26, 2020, and unable to update all data points except for Currently hospitalized, Currently in ICU, and Currently on ventilator on November 27, 2020.\n\nOn November 11, 2020, Maine did not update testing and hospitalization data: only **Cases,** **Deaths,** and **Recovered** were updated.\n\nOn November 2, 2020, Maine started reporting antigen and molecular tests separately on the state's dashboard.\n\nOn June 23, 2020, Maine began reporting the dates of **cases**, **deaths**, **recoveries**, and **hospitalizations** on the day they occurred instead of the day the event was reported. Maine also began providing separate figures for **Deaths (probable)** and **Deaths (confirmed)**.\n\nAs of May 20, 2020, Maine reports PCR tests and antibody tests separately."},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/6/2021 23:59","dateModified":"March 6, 2021 11:59 pm"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":3,"ltc":1,"crdt":2},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml","name":"Maine","state":"ME","twitter":"@mainedhhs","childSlug":{"slug":"maine"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
