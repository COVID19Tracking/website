As of May 26, 2020, Mississippi no longer reports this metric. On February 11, 2021, we cleared Mississippi's Positive antibody tests (specimens) timeseries to ensure that our data is as accurate and consistent as possible.\n\nOn October 25, 2020, Mississippi announced that COVID-19 data for October 24, 2020 and October 25, 2020 would be published on Monday. As a result, Mississippi did not update on October 24, 2020 and October 25, 2020.\n\nOn September 15, 2020, Mississippi resumed reporting current hospitalizations, ICU, and ventilations on the source we have historically used for this metric. We are working to backfill these data points in our historical data.\n\nOn September 11, 2020, we discovered a new source for Mississippi current hospitalizations and current ICU admissions on the Mississippi State Department of Health website.\n\nBetween June 17 and June 22, 2020, Mississippi experienced technical difficulties with their reporting system. We filled in five days of **case** and **death** data on June 22, 2020.\n\nOn May 26, 2020, news reports indicated that 95 antibody tests had returned positive in Mississippi, but we have not found more recent data since then for this metric.\n\nAs of May 23, 2020, Mississippi is separating out PCR and antibody tests. We now report both separately. \n"},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/6/2021 00:00","dateModified":"March 6, 2021 12:00 am"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":3,"ltc":1,"crdt":2},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,21994,420,873.html","covid19SiteTertiary":null,"name":"Mississippi","state":"MS","twitter":"@msdh","childSlug":{"slug":"mississippi"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
