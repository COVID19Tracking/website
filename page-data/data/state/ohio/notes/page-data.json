As a result of this change, Deaths (confirmed + probable) decreased from 17,346 to 17,189 on March 2, 2021. To allow our data quality team time to evaluate this change, we did not record this change on March 2, 2021, and backfilled our timeseries on March 3, 2021.\n\nAs of March 2, 2021, Ohio no longer reports Deaths (confirmed) and Deaths (probable) on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview/). As a result, we are unable to update these metrics.\n\nFrom February 10, 2021 through March 1, 2021, Ohio reconciled their death data. As a result, death figures from this period may fluctuate more than normal, and may include deaths which were not reported in the previous 24 hours. We urge caution when interpreting data from this period and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics. Our data quality team will continue to investigate how best to handle changes to their data.\n\nOhio continually updates its **Currently hospitalized / Now hospitalized** data which can cause slight differences between their historic data and ours. \n\nOn February 10, 2021, Ohio [announced](https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/media-center/odh-news-releases/odh-news-release-02-10-20) that up to 4,000 COVID-19 deaths were underreported in the stateâ€™s reporting system and on their COVID-29 dashboard. These deaths will be added to their counts over the week on February 11, 2021. As a result, new deaths will be substantially higher than normal throughout this period. We urge caution when interpreting data from this period. Our data quality team will continue to investigate how best to handle the addition of these death. Approximately 650 of the deaths reported on February 11, 2021, 2500 of the deaths reported on February 12, 2021, and 1125 of the deaths reported on February 13, 2021 are a result of this reconciliation. On February 15, 2021, Ohio noted that they were continuing to reconcile deaths through a deep review of data which may result in fluctuations in death data.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, we switched Ohio's `totalTestResults` to draw from `totalTestsViral` instead of by calculating from positive+negative. \n\nOn December 29, 2020, Ohio provided a timeseries of Total Tests (PCR), Positive Tests (PCR), Total Antigen Tests, and Positive Antigen Tests. On January 6, 2021, we backfilled all 4 metrics from this download, which resulted in the addition of three new metrics (positive tests PCR, positive tests antigen, total tests antigen) and a full history for Total Tests (PCR).\n\nOn December 25, 2020, Ohio announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview/) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data for December 26, 2020 will include numbers from both December 25, 2020 and December 26, 2020. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the holiday, and that data for January 2, 2021 will include numbers from both January 1, 2021 and January 2, 2021. \n\nOn December 19, 2020, Ohio announced that the case numbers for December 19, 2020 may be slightly lower than otherwise due to a technical issue.\n\nOn December 8, 2020, Ohio announced that their data for December 8, 2020 includes a backlog of roughly 13,000 antigen tests dating back to November 1, 2020. As a result not all new **Probable cases** and **Total cases** were reported in the previous 24 hour period. This followed the state reporting on it's COVID-19 Dashboard that the data was incomplete and \"because of unprecedented volume, thousands of reports are pending review\" from November 18, 2020 to December 7, 2020.  \n\nOn November 26, 2020, Ohio announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that there would not be a data update on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, the data that would normally have been reported on November 26, 2020 will be included in the November 27, 2020 update.\n\nOn November 23, 2020 Ohio announced that their data for November 23, 2020 would include two days worth of positive test results which were delayed due to technical issues affecting lab reporting. Additionally, on November 23, 2020, Ohio did not update their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** by the time of our daily update. Because `Negative` is calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, we did not update them on November 23, 2020.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, Ohio reported 5246480 **Total PCR tests (specimens)** - the same number that was reported on November 15, 2020, and a drop of roughly 102k tests from November 17, 2020. Because Ohio announced that their data for November 18, 2020 would be incomplete, and we suspect this decrease was a result of that, we did not update **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, or `Negative` on November 18, 2020.\n"},"covidState":{"lastUpdateEt":"3/7/2021 14:00","dateModified":"March 7, 2021 2:00 pm"},"covidGradeStateAssessment":{"taco":2,"ltc":2,"crdt":2},"assessmentDate":{"date":"2021-03-02"}},"pageContext":{"covid19Site":"https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview/","covid19SiteSecondary":"https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/key-metrics/cases","covid19SiteTertiary":"https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/key-metrics/hospitalizations","name":"Ohio","state":"OH","twitter":"@OHdeptofhealth","childSlug":{"slug":"ohio"},"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
