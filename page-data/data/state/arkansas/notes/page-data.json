We do not count these individuals in our deaths metric, consistent with our policy of tracking only individuals with COVID as a cause of death where possible.\n\nOn February 28, 2021, Arkansas’s total Deaths decreased by over 200. Arkansas [stated](https://twitter.com/ADHPIO/status/1366163333225799682) that this decrease was because of data clean-up and deduplication.\n\nDuring the week of September 20, 2020, Arkansas made some continual adjustments to its antigen people tested numbers, resulting in some fluctuation in its negatives and totals.\n\nAs of September 18, 2020, Arkansas's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. The totals do not include repeat positives—counting individuals only for their first positive—but do count repeat negative tests.\n\nOn September 16, 2020, Arkansas’s **Negative Tests (PCR)** dropped by 26,801 tests, causing its **Total Tests (PCR)** to drop by 26,195 tests due to the reversal of a data dump of negative test results. It also added 140 **Probable deaths**, not all of which dated to September 16.\n\nOn September 3, 2020, Arkansas began reporting **Probable cases** according to the most recent CSTE definitions, in addition to confirmed cases. This added 423 new cases to AR’s **Total cases** number.\n\nOn Aug 15, 2020, Arkansas data changed due to deduplication and the state's removal of out-of-state cases from its dataset. These changes resulted in reductions in **Total cases**, **Ever hospitalized**, and **Ever in ICU** data. \n\nBetween July 30, 2020 and September 17, 2020, Arkansas provided Total, Positive, and Negative Antigen tests (specimens) sporadically and then stopped reporting them. This data can be found in our API.
