We backfilled the data for March 24, 2020 through March 1, 2021 using the time-series posted in Tennessee's [Downloadable Datasets](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/downloadable-datasets.html). We also cleared the history of Negative (people or cases) since it was calculated using mixed units.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, the Tennessee Department of Health [announced](https://twitter.com/TNDeptofHealth/status/1345117770543996940?s=20) that its update for January 2, 2021 would include data from both January 1 and January 2, presumably because of the holiday. We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Tennessee’s separate [hospitalization source](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/hospitalization-data/current-covid-hospitalizations.html).\n\nOn December 25, 2020, Tennessee did not provide a data update, likely due to the holiday. We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Tennessee’s separate [hospitalization source](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/hospitalization-data/current-covid-hospitalizations.html). Additionally, they [noted](https://twitter.com/TNDeptofHealth/status/1342952651022086147) that the data reported on December 26, 2020, included two days of data, and that the number of deaths reported were “limited” due to the holiday.\n\nOn December 19, 2020, Tennessee announced that due to the volume of tests being processed they will likely release a combined report with data from both December 19, 2020 and December 20, 2020 on December 20, 2020. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 20, 2020.\n\nOn December 12, 2020, Tennessee [announced](https://twitter.com/tndeptofhealth/status/1337869853621964805?s=21) via the official Tennessee Department of Heath twitter that the data for December 12, 2020 is incomplete and does not include all negative test results. Please exercise caution when looking at data from this time period and be aware that 7 day averages may be a more reliable metric than individual figures at this moment.\n\nAs of July 3, 2020, **Now hospitalized** data includes both positive and pending cases. We have updated hospitalizations for March 31–July 3 to include both positive and pending cases as well.\n\nAs of June 10, 2020, **Total cases** include both confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 reported to or tested by the Tennessee Department of Health. \n\nOn April 5, 2020, Tennessee reported a decline in **Recoveries**.
