Testing and reporting activity slows down on weekends, and health care staff and public health officials tend to “catch up” with their data reporting on Mondays and Tuesdays, causing spikes in the numbers later in the week. Some states report some metrics once per week, which will cause a spike on the day of the week they report that metric. Holidays can create backlogs of data, causing large apparent decreases followed by large apparent increases: read more about that <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/blog/daily-covid-19-data-is-about-to-get-weird\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>There are also other occasions when a lab or a county “dumps” a great deal of data all at once on a particular day, which makes the state’s numbers for that day unusually large. We try to report all such unusual data spikes in the public notes on <a href=\"/data\">each state’s data page</a> and on our <a href=\"http://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking\">Twitter feed</a>.</p>\n<p>In general, any date in our data should be understood to be <a href=\"/about-data/data-definitions#state-metadata\">defined as</a> “the date on which data was collected by The COVID Tracking Project,” which is generally the date the state reported the data point to the public in its cumulative totals. We recommend analyzing our data with 7-day or 14-day averages instead of with single day values to help mitigate the effect of these reporting spikes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-doesnt-your-data-match-what-i-see-on-the-official-covid-19-page-for-my-state\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-doesnt-your-data-match-what-i-see-on-the-official-covid-19-page-for-my-state\" aria-label=\"why doesnt your data match what i see on the official covid 19 page for my state permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why doesn’t your data match what I see on the official COVID-19 page for my state?</h2>\n<p>There are several reasons why our tracker might show different data than your state’s COVID-19 page, even when we use that same page as a source:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Date lag</strong>. We update the dataset by hand once a day and release the data between about 5:30pm and 7pm Eastern Time. If a state updates its data after our daily compilation, we won’t pick up the new information until the next day.</li>\n<li><strong>Hidden data</strong>. In some cases, we retrieve data that states do not display on their public dashboards from data files that the state provides. This data is still public and still official, but might only be visible “behind the scenes” of a data dashboard or in an obscure corner of the state’s COVID-19 site. Missouri, for example, does not display the value for <em>Total PCR tests (in specimens)</em> on its dashboard, but the data is there, though not displayed, and we retrieve it with a machine query.</li>\n<li><strong>Different data definitions</strong>. In the absence of national data standards, we might use the same name for a metric as your state but use a <a href=\"/about-data/data-definitions\">different definition</a>. For instance, our case, death, and hospitalization metrics all include “probable” and “suspected” cases for states that report them, whereas your state might include only lab-confirmed cases in its official case count while reporting probable cases separately.</li>\n<li><strong>Different ways of reporting “new” cases, tests, or deaths</strong>. Please note that our “new” values for cases, tests, deaths and other metrics are calculated as <a href=\"/about-data/data-definitions\">the increase in the total cumulative value reported by the state since yesterday</a>. States themselves, however, frequently define “new” cases, tests, and deaths differently. See o<a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/about-data/faq?edit#why-are-your-new-cases-tests-or-deaths-counts-for-my-state-different-from-the-new-counts-my-state-reports\">ur FAQ on “new” data points below</a> for more information.</li>\n<li><strong>Backfilled / backdated data</strong>. As explained above, we report data once each day on the date the state adds that data to its systems, whereas states themselves frequently “backfill” data, meaning that they enter data for previous days. By doing this, states can connect data points to pertinent dates such as the date a death occurred or the date a laboratory completed its analysis of a test. For instance, Florida’s <a href=\"http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf\">state report</a> includes a graph titled “COVID-19: cases and laboratory testing over time” whose numbers by date change frequently: on <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/globalassets/covid19/dailies/sept-2020/state_reports_20200909.pdf\">9/9/20 the graph reported 2352 cases for 9/8/2020</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/globalassets/covid19/dailies/sept-2020/state_reports_20200910.pdf\">9/10/2020 the graph reported 2337 cases for 9/8/2020</a>. Similarly, Rhode Island <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2QrNMz8pIbYEKzMJL7Uh2dtThOJa2j1sSMwiDo5Gz4/edit#gid=1592746937\">continually revises its historic values for “Cumulative people who tested positive”</a> as they receive more results from laboratories, so our time series falls out of sync with the state’s time series. We do sometimes backfill our own historic data when states provide us with a time series for a metric in a structured format.

Our volunteers manually update our numbers by visiting state/territory public health websites once a day, annotating any changes to data sources or data anomalies as they go. Our volunteers are often retrieving data from sources such as PDFs and livestreams of press conferences that automated tools have not been engineered to capture.</li>\n<li><strong>Time lag</strong>. When other trackers rely on automated tools to collect data from state/territory public health authorities, their counts tend to be updated more frequently than ours. We currently spend about three hours every afternoon collecting data, and we publish it only once each day.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Data sources other than states/territories.</strong> Other trackers retrieve data directly from sources other than the state/territory public health authorities we use for our dataset.</p>\n<p>   Many other trackers, including Johns Hopkins, USAFacts.org, and <em>The New York Times</em>, rely on <strong>county data rather than state data</strong>. While counties do report their data to the state, in practice the sum total of county data points can often differ from the totals the state reports, probably because the state normalizes county data to its own standards.</p>\n<p> The CDC has direct access to <strong>other sources of data</strong> in addition to state public health authorities. For instance, as of August 25, 2020, the CDC reports <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#testing\">on its COVID-19 testing tracker</a> that “The data for each state are sourced from either data submitted directly by the state health department via COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting (CELR), or a combination of commercial, public health, and in-house hospital laboratories.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Different data definitions</strong>. States/territories define data points in inconsistent ways, and the various trackers deal with those inconsistent definitions differently. For example, “deaths” is treated very differently by various states and trackers, especially when it comes to “probable deaths,” which are not reported by all states or trackers.</p>\n<p>   <strong>The state of New York, for instance, <a href=\"/data/state/new-york/notes\">does not report a significant number of deaths from COVID-19 reported by the city of New York</a>, including thousands of <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/about-data/data-definitions#outcomes\">probable deaths</a>.</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/331\">Worldometer includes the NYC probables in its death counts, whereas The COVID Tracking Project does not</a>.

This way of calculating “new” data points is a function of how we collect data. For the most part, we enter data manually once each day by visiting the state’s official COVID-19 data sites, and we capture, record, and report the cumulative totals reported by the state to the public on that day.</p>\n<p>States themselves, however, frequently enter data into their systems for previous dates. Cases might be recorded by the state with dates such as “date of symptom onset,” which is not usually the same as the first date the state reports that case to the public. Tests might be recorded by the state with dates such as “specimen collection date,” which might not be the same as the first date the state reported that test to the public. Deaths might be recorded by the state with dates such as “date of death,” which is not usually the same as the first date the state reports that death to the public.</p>\n<p>On a Friday, for example, a state might enter five tests into its public reporting system, one whose specimen was collected on Wednesday, two whose specimens were collected on Thursday, and two whose specimens were collected on Friday. In that example, the state might report “2 new tests” for that Friday and we might report “5 new tests” for that Friday.\nWe recommend analyzing our data with 7-day or 14-day averages instead of with single day values to help mitigate the effect of these reporting spikes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-you-sometimes-report-the-same-value-for-multiple-days\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-do-you-sometimes-report-the-same-value-for-multiple-days\" aria-label=\"why do you sometimes report the same value for multiple days permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why do you sometimes report the same value for multiple days?</h2>\n<p>Not all states and territories report all data points daily.

The same is true for death data, recovery data, and hospitalization data: those values should (barring mistakes) represent unique individuals.</p>\n<p>Testing figures, however, might or might not include multiple tests administered to the same person: it depends on how the state “deduplicates” that data, meaning how it identifies and removes (or chooses not to remove) redundant / repeated information. It also depends to an extent on what units the state reports COVID-19 tests in. Some states report test results in units of “specimens tested,” some states report test results in units of “people tested,” some states report in units of “testing encounters” (meaning the number of times one person was tested), and some states report test results in more than one of these ways.

Although there are other ways to identify probable cases, many states and territories use only antigen tests to identify probable cases. However, even when probable case counts include only individuals testing positive via antigen, they are different from a count of antigen positive individuals. </p>\n<p>That’s because probable case counts are revised down if those cases are confirmed via a PCR test, a common occurrence. A count of antigen positive individuals tested, by contrast, never gets revised down. It is just a tally of everyone with a positive antigen test result. Both numbers provide valuable information but for different purposes. We capture probable cases in our API field <code>probableCases</code> and antigen positive individuals in <code>positiveTestsPeopleAntigen</code>. (And when states release the number of positive antigen tests rather than individuals testing positive, we store that number in <code>positiveTestsAntigen</code>.)</p>\n<p>States are not always crystal clear about which of these two categories they are using. We make the decision about which category states’ figures fall into based on a combination of information on health department websites and outreach to state health departments. Where we are unable to determine whether a metric is counting probable cases or antigen positive individuals, we store their numbers in <code>positiveTestsPeopleAntigen</code>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-you-list-56-states\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-do-you-list-56-states\" aria-label=\"why do you list 56 states permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why do you list 56 states?</h2>\n<p>We track data for the District of Columbia as well as for US territories including American Samoa, Guam, the Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.

Some states use the CDC definition for COVID-19 patients released from isolation to estimate recoveries, while some states define recovery in their own way, often considering COVID-19 patients who have not died within a certain interval of time after infection as “recovered,” no matter what their state of health: these <strong>Recovered</strong> figures therefore include people who suffer medium-term or long-term disability caused by COVID-19. Some states do not give any indication how they define or calculate recoveries.</p>\n<p>To avoid confusion, as of November 16, 2020 we have stopped displaying the national value for <strong>Recovered</strong> COVID-19 patients <a href=\"/data/national/deaths\">on our website</a>, and the metric <code>recovered</code> will be deprecated in and then removed from the API in December.

For example, since more states report the number of people <em>currently</em> in the ICU or on a ventilator than report them cumulatively, the national numbers for individuals currently in the ICU or on a ventilator sometimes exceed the cumulative values.</p>\n<p>To avoid confusion, as of November 16, 2020 we have therefore decided to stop displaying these national sums of cumulative hospitalization, ICU, and ventilated values on our website, although the fields remain available in our API.

This table included screenshots, new tests, cases, negative test results, pending test results, hospitalized, deaths, and total test results. We removed this table because reporting “Negative” and “Total” test results so simply was misleading, given the multiple ways that states report test results, and given our legacy practice of calculating a state’s total tests by adding its positive and negative test results.</p>\n<p>In the original historical data table, the “Negative” test results and “Total” test results could sometimes refer to different data (people tested, specimens tested, or testing encounters). We did a great deal of work to make sure that we were reporting different test units accurately for our <a href=\"/blog/site-redesign\">website redesign of August 25</a>, and we have moved the old “Total” figure on the state’s data page to the state’s history page for the category of <strong>Viral (PCR) Tests</strong>,  where it appears as <strong>“Total test results - legacy (positive + negative).”</strong></p>\n<p>We realize that the full history page was a convenient way to get a time series of data elements for a single state. As the datasets of individual states change and our knowledge of those datasets improves, however, it has become clear that COVID-19 test and outcome reporting is getting even more complex than it was to begin with.

(You can read more about the motivation behind this policy change at the question directly above or <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/blog/counting-covid-19-tests\">here</a>). As of September 17, we had been able to make that switch for four states: Colorado, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Rhode Island, and the current list of included states is available in the “API Changes” section of <a href=\"/about-data/total-tests\">our total tests documentation page</a>, and each state page is also annotated on its <a href=\"/data\">data page</a>. Future changes will immediately affect the US <em>totalTestResults</em> API field.</p>\n<p>However, we did not immediately change the national <em>totalTestResults</em> field of our API, which continued to use positive+negative until September 17. This changeover resulted in a cumulative increase of 2,136,206 US tests. These tests are distributed over the entire time series back to March, so the daily difference is smaller, comprising 57,400 additional tests (about an 8% increase) on September 17.</p>\n<p>These upticks are expected when we prioritize counting total tests in units of specimens and test encounters, which include repeat testing, over positive+negative, which usually does not. All four states whose <em>totalTestResults</em> we have switched used to reflect unique people, explaining the large cumulative difference.</p>\n<p>Please do not use the <em>posNeg</em> field on the national level.

Most commonly, states chose to report “total tests” either in units of “specimens” (e.g., number of nasal swabs processed by a laboratory, even if a single person provided more than one swab) or in units of “people” (individuals tested for COVID-19). In many cases states have not made clear exactly how they are counting “tests” at all.</p>\n<p>Given the substantial lack of clarity and consistency in total test results definitions between states, The COVID Tracking Project created the “Total Test Results,” totalTestsResults field in our API, to assemble a national number, operating by a simple principle to fill it: we took whatever we could get. In the early months of our work, since we preferred to report in units of “people” rather than specimens, this usually meant summing a state’s figures for individuals receiving positive and negative results, because even when states directly provided a figure for total tests, that figure was often unclear or in units of “specimens.”</p>\n<p>While we are still far from having a national data standard on how to count tests, most states have clarified their definitions enough that we can start switching states from using calculated positive+negative totals to using explicitly reported “total tests” figures in our main totalTestResults API field and our Total Test Results figures on our website. To support this change, we are launching a new policy about which units of total tests we prioritize in that column and are making it more evident which ones we are using in each state. The current list of included states is available in the “API Changes” section of <a href=\"/about-data/total-tests\">our total tests documentation page</a>, and each state page is also annotated on its <a href=\"/data\">data page</a>.</p>\n<p>Because we are rolling out these modifications gradually, you will see some movement in state/territorial totals for the totalTestResults API field and the Total Test Results figures on each state page. We will keep you posted whenever we make a change to the way we count a state’s test figures—each state and territory has its own page on our site, linked to from the main Our Data page, and our notes for these changes will appear that page, on each state page, in our notes for the state, in our API and relevant CSVs, as well as in a forthcoming central repository for everything we know about state and territorial test units.</p>\n<p>Read more about the context of these changes <a href=\"/blog/counting-covid-19-tests\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"questions-about-information-we-dont-report\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#questions-about-information-we-dont-report\" aria-label=\"questions about information we dont report permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Questions about information we don’t report</h1>\n<h2 id=\"why-dont-you-report-test-positivity-rates\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-dont-you-report-test-positivity-rates\" aria-label=\"why dont you report test positivity rates permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why don’t you report test positivity rates?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/test-positivity\">Test positivity</a>, also called the “percent positive rate” or “positivity rate,” can change dramatically depending on which total test metric is used as the denominator.

The COVID Tracking Project does not currently calculate test positivity rates and will not do so until we are confident in our ability to communicate precisely about these complex issues. We urge caution when relying on any (governmental or non-governmental) test positivity calculation that does not transparently and prominently address the question of inconsistencies across jurisdictions.

query, and otherwise capture data automatically, but because the 56 states and territories provide the dozens of data points we collect in so many different ways, and because they change and move and revise their systems and definitions for this data so continually, we rely on human intelligence first and technology second.</p>","headings":[{"id":"questions-about-the-end-of-the-covid-tracking-projects-data-collection","value":"Questions about the end of The COVID Tracking Project’s data
