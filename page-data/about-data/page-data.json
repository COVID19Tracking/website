We compile these numbers to provide the most complete picture we can assemble of the US COVID-19 testing effort and the outbreak’s effects on the people and communities it strikes.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to use the data, whether it’s for a specialized project or just to better understand COVID-19 in the US, here are a few things you should know right away.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We update <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/\">the full dataset</a> each day between about 5:30pm and 7pm Eastern time, with limited additional updates as new information arrives.</li>\n<li>All our data comes from state and territory public health authorities or official statements from state officials.
