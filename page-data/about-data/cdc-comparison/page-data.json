If these numbers continue to be regularly reported and aligned, The COVID Tracking Project will begin using the CDC’s case and death counts in our public reporting and API.</li>\n<li>The <strong>new testing data</strong> from the CDC, however, differs from official testing data reported by state health departments. <strong>In 29 states, the raw numbers fall within 10% of each other</strong>, while <strong>in 13 states, the data diverges by 25% or more</strong>. Adjusting for different reporting methodologies does not fully explain these differences.</li>\n<li>Small variations in these datasets are to be expected, but large gaps are cause for concern. For many states, the CDC publishes <strong>higher testing numbers than the states themselves report</strong>, which raises questions about the structure and integrity of both state and federal data reporting.</li>\n<li>Another point of contrast between the CDC’s new reporting and the official state data compiled by The COVID Tracking Project is that <strong>the CDC has not released historical, state-level testing data for the first three months of the outbreak</strong>. Until we can reconcile the CDC’s new data with the state-reported data that makes up our historical dataset, the new data is of limited use to disease modelers and other COVID-19 data users.</li>\n<li>As part of our accountability mission, The COVID Tracking Project team will do everything we can to <strong>understand and close the gaps between the state and federal data</strong>. That work begins with this assessment, and will continue as we integrate the CDC data into our dataset and data API.</li>\n</ul>","headings":[{"id":"highlights-from-the-report","value":"Highlights from the report:","depth":3}]}},"socialCard":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"95296839-3517-529b-a3b7-b4aebbbabdef","slug":"about-data/cdc-comparison","latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3565063634","3649515864","4121435362","775579208"]}
