This dataset is updated only once per month because of the complexity of working with such extremely detailed data, and the data itself is very unwieldy to work with—the downloadable version currently has <strong>nearly 21 million rows</strong>. The CDC’s COVID Data Tracker uses this dataset to provide <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics\">a daily snapshot of current trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths by race/ethnicity,</a> but these trends are not available in a timeseries---only the most current national counts and percentages are provided.</p>\n<p>Because this data contains identifying and sensitive information, the CDC provides both a 12-data-element public-use dataset of the line list and a 32-data-element restricted-access dataset of the same data that includes potentially identifying information. The public use dataset includes fields for <code>sex</code>, <code>age_group</code>, and <code>race_ethnicity_combined</code>, information about whether the person was hospitalized or sent to the ICU, as well as four separate fields that can help assign a date to the case: the date the person said their symptoms began, the date the person’s diagnostic test had a positive result, the date the case was reported to the CDC, and the earliest available of these three dates. The restricted use dataset includes the state and county of residence of each person reported to have contracted COVID-19, as well as information on whether the person is a healthcare worker.
