Some states report new cases, tests, and deaths using other methods. Please consult official state data sources for more information. We chart “New tests” using different units across jurisdictions, because not all states and territories report tests in the same units. Learn more about total test units and see what we chart for each jurisdiction in our <a href=\"/about-data/total-tests/\">total tests documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>We do not have a complete dataset for every metric in every state. If we have data for less than 30% of the past 90 days for a given metric, you’ll see a warning instead of a chart for that metric.</p>\n<p>All the data for these charts is <a href=\"/data/download\">available for download</a>.
