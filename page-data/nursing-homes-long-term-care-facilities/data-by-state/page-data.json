Since states had no uniform method of reporting the data put forth by the federal government, none of the data is standardized.</p>\n<p>We preserved categories like facility type, staff and resident cases and deaths and outbreak and cumulative cases in every possible instance, which means these data points vary from state to state. <strong>Because of this, it’s important to note that comparisons across states using certain metrics cannot always be easily made.</strong> We documented each state’s unique reporting practices, sudden spikes, drops, definitional changes, and data anomalies to help guide your understanding and use of the data. We encourage all analysis to be approached with these notes in mind.</p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"latestDate":"2021-03-07","sevenDaysAgo":"2021-02-28","fourteenDaysAgo":"2021-02-21","twentyEightDaysAgo":"2021-02-07","ninetyDaysAgo":"2020-12-07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1039529027","3565063634","3649515864","4121435362","775579208","86190053"]}
