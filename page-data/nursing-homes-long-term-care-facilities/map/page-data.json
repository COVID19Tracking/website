Over the past year, as COVID-19 outbreaks erupted at long-term-care facilities across the nation, state health departments reported the data in fragmented and unstandardized pieces—if they reported it at all. In May 2020, The COVID Tracking Project began gathering COVID-19 data from nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, and other long-term-care facilities from every state that provided it, to build our Long-Term-Care COVID Tracker into <strong>the most comprehensive collection of long-term-care-facility information available.</strong></p>\n<p>Our entire <a href=\"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/long-term-care-data/blob/master/facilities_all_states.csv\">facility-level database</a> of cases and deaths is available for download, and state specific facility-level data can be found on individual <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/nursing-homes-long-term-care-facilities/data-by-state\">state page</a>.

We have tried to make the data formatting as consistent as possible, to be able to compare numbers across states, and we’ve tried to match all nursing home facility names to their corresponding federal identification numbers. There are certainly limitations to this approach, and we expect there will be some discrepancies. Additionally, we expect that some assisted-living facilities and other long-term-care facility locations and names may not match up with physical facility locations and names. </p>\n<p>This map is our best attempt to visualize every state-reported COVID-19 case or death tied to a long-term-care facility in the United States. If our data shows that a state reported data for current outbreak (yellow) rather than cumulative data (purple), we show the current outbreak data—though it’s worth remembering that every state defines a “current outbreak” differently.
